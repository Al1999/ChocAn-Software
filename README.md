# Chocoholics Anonymous Data Processing

  The Chocoholics Anonymous Data Processing software will handle data processing for requests made through
provider and manager terminals via simulated keyboard inputs. Healthcare professionals
partnering with ChocAn (provider) and managers at ChocAn are stakeholders because they
are the direct users of the software product through their corresponding terminals.
Conversely, people seeking medical care through ChocAn (members) are the users, as they
merely rely on the ability of the software, operated by providers and managers, to keep
records, control membership status, and bill members. The main goals of this software
product is to store data regarding services provided to members; to provide stakeholders
with reports; to manage members; and to track and record financial information provided
by Acme Accounting Services. Providers, through their terminal, will be able to check
membership status, bill ChocAn for provided services, and access a provider directory.
Managers, through their terminal, shall be able to update both member and provider
records, including provider and member status, and generate reports from existing data.
Finally, the software shall be able to generate member, provider, manager, and financial
reports from existing data. These reports will be generated at the end of the week from
records of services provided and sent to members using a third-party e-mail system.
